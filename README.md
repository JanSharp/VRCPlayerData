# Player Data

A library for systems to keep track of player associated data, including offline players and import/export.

# Installing

(It's not actually published as a package yet, but once it is the following applies.)

Head to my [VCC Listing](https://jansharp.github.io/vrc/vcclisting.xhtml) and follow the instructions there.

# Contributing

This project uses [custom git filters](.gitattributes) to reduce the amount of noise generated by Udon and UdonSharp. These filters are not required in order to contribute, though without them all UdonSharp asset files will show as modified and those "changes" should not be committed.
